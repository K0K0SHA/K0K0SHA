- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
For questions about code, GitHub is a great way to contact me.
I'm aware of the whole botnet problem. So, if you would like to chat using privacy-central methods I am all for it.
You won't find me as easily on mainstream media such as Facebook, Twitch, Telegram, Skype, etc. I'm privacy-focused.


I also hang around on certain forums. You'll find me there. Lurking, at least.
Forums I hang around on include:

/g/, particularly /psg/ formerly /cyb/
/o/
XDA
lain
